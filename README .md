# **1. PROJECT NAME:**
- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in NLTK.

**2. PROJECT OVERVIEW:**

- This project is an example of POS tagging using HMM.
- It uses the nltk library for data preprocessing, training the HMM tagger, and tagging new sentences.
- The goal of this project is to train an HMM tagger on a dataset of tagged sentences to predict the POS tags of new sentences.

**3. DATASET:**

**4.** **FEATURES:**

- Loads data from the Brown Corpus using nltk's TaggedCorpusReader.
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Trains an HMM tagger on the training set using nltk's HiddenMarkovModelTagger
- Evaluates the accuracy of the tagger on the testing set.
- Tags new sentences using the trained HMM tagger.

**5. USAGE:**

- ` `Load the data: The input data for this project is expected to be in the form of tagged sentences. The code provided loads data from the Brown Corpus using nltk's TaggedCorpusReader.
- Train the model: The code provided trains an HMM tagger on the loaded tagged sentences. It performs data preprocessing, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and then trains an HMM tagger using nltk's HiddenMarkovModelTagger.
- Evaluate the model: The accuracy of the trained model is evaluated on the testing set using the evaluate method of the HMM tagger.
- Tag new sentences: To tag new sentences, tokenize the sentence using nltk's word\_tokenize method and then tag the tokens using the trained HMM tagger.
- Accuracy obtained= 94.89%
